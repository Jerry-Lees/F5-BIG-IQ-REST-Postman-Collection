## *Warning*

This is not for the faint at heart, care must be taken to issue commands in the proper order and watching the results as you progress. Remember, this is a framework for interfacing with the REST API of BIG-IQ. This operates at a very low level and has it's inherent risks of human error.

## Installation

## Getting Started

Just like building a configuration in TMSH or TM GUI, everything builds on either creating or selecting particular configuration items.
For example, to create a pool, you would need a monitor and pool members consisting of Nodes that have been created and the port to send traffic to. This is all done by issueing queries to the REST API and then storing the needed configuration items' information into the environment variables that are used in later calls to create, modify, or delete objects.
